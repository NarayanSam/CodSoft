***CodSoft Project Repository: Tribute Page and Travel Booking System***
Welcome to the repository for my internship project! In this repository, you will find the code and resources related to the development of a Tribute Page and a Travel Booking System. These projects were developed as a part of my internship to showcase my skills and learning in web development.

***Tribute Page***
The Tribute Page is a simple web page dedicated to honoring __Rabindranath Tagore__. The page briefly overviews his accomplishments, contributions, and impact on society. The primary purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to create a visually appealing and informative single-page website using HTML and CSS.

***Features:***
Responsive design to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
Aesthetic layout with carefully chosen colors, typography, and imagery.
Structured content to present essential information in a clear and organized manner.
